# Practicing-Python-1
Creating a simple web server.  The web server class inherits from BaseHTTPRequestHandler. 

To run the server:
    - download both the python and html files to the same folder
    - open your command line interpreter 
    - change directories to the folder you downloaded your files to
    - run the .py file using Python 3.6 or later versions
